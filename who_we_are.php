          <p style="float:left;">Driven by real-time social conversation, crises are costly to your reputation, profits, and growth. The vulnerability today is not limited to obvious catastrophes such as a plant explosion or product recall; rather, social media makes a crisis out of an innocent photo taken by an employee, a careless tweet from an executive, or a falsehood posted on Facebook by someone with an axe to grind or five minutes to kill.</p>
          <p>Crises are now MADE UP OF A STRING OF CRITICAL NANO-MOMENTS. Each is important on its own because each one alters the trajectory of the conversation. These moments gain momentum and mass at inferno-speed. The crises they create are, in a word, chaotic. The job is not just to control the chaos, but master it. Firebell develops that mastery.</p>
